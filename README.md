# üß† Brain Tumour Detection Using CNN (MRI Classification)


## üìå Project Summary

This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify MRI brain scans as either having a tumor or no tumor. By leveraging supervised deep learning techniques, specifically CNNs, the model achieves high accuracy in detecting abnormalities in medical imaging, aiding early diagnosis and treatment planning.

## üéØ Project Goal

To develop a robust and accurate deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks for binary image classification (tumor vs. no tumor).

To automate brain tumor detection from MRI scans and assist radiologists in medical diagnosis.

## ‚ùì Problem Statement

Brain tumors can be life-threatening and often require early diagnosis for effective treatment. Manual detection from MRI images is time-consuming and subject to human error. The goal is to develop an AI-based system that:

Detects the presence of brain tumors from MRI images.

Provides accurate predictions with minimal false negatives/positives.

Offers a reliable model suitable for integration into clinical workflows.

### Step 2: Load Dataset

In this step, I verified the working directory to ensure that the dataset path was correctly set. 
This is crucial to prevent file-not-found errors when loading MRI image data. 
I used the os module to check and confirm that the current working directory matches the dataset location, which is essential for accessing and loading image files for further processing.

| **Python Code**                                                                           | **# Comments**                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `import os`                                                                               | Used to interact with the file system and manage paths.                               |
| `print(os.getcwd())`                                                                      | Printed the current working directory to verify that it points to the dataset folder. |
| **Output:** `D:\Projects\Deep Learning Projects\Brain Tumor Detection Using CNN\datasets` | Confirms that the dataset directory is correctly set for loading images.              |

To begin processing the brain tumor MRI data, I ensured that the script pointed to the correct working directory. 
I verified the current directory using os.getcwd() and updated it using os.chdir() to match the dataset location. 
Then, I defined the dataset path and loaded the image file names from the respective folders: 'yes' (tumor present) and 'no' (no tumor). This setup is necessary before beginning the image preprocessing and labeling phase.

| **Python Code**                                                                                              | **# Comments**                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `import os`                                                                                                  | Module used for directory operations.                                    |
| `print("Current Directory:", os.getcwd())`                                                                   | Printed the current working directory to verify initial script location. |
| **Output:** `Current Directory: D:\Projects\Deep Learning Projects\Brain Tumor Detection Using CNN\datasets` | Confirms the initial directory before any change.                        |
| `os.chdir(r"D:\Projects\Deep Learning Projects\Brain Tumor Detection Using CNN\datasets")`                   | Changed the working directory to the dataset folder.                     |
| `print("Current Directory:", os.getcwd())`                                                                   | Verified the change to ensure the correct path is active.                |
| **Output:** `Current Directory: D:\Projects\Deep Learning Projects\Brain Tumor Detection Using CNN\datasets` | Confirms that directory change was successful.                           |
| `image_directory = r'D:\Projects\Deep Learning Projects\Brain Tumor Detection Using CNN\datasets\\'`         | Defined the base path for accessing the 'yes' and 'no' image folders.    |
| `no_tumor_images = os.listdir(image_directory + 'no/')`                                                      | Loaded file names of all MRI images labeled as "no tumor".               |
| `yes_tumor_images = os.listdir(image_directory + 'yes/')`                                                    | Loaded file names of all MRI images labeled as "tumor present".          |


### Step 3: Image Preprocessing and Label Assignment

In this step, I initialized empty lists to store image data and their corresponding labels. 
I then looped through all the MRI images in both the 'no' and 'yes' tumor directories. 
Each image was read using OpenCV, converted from BGR to RGB using Pillow (PIL), resized to a standard input size for the CNN, and then appended to the dataset as a NumPy array. 
Labels were assigned as 0 for no tumor and 1 for tumor present. I also ensured the dataset remained a Python list to avoid potential type issues during processing.

| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dataset = []`<br>`labels = []`                                  | I reset both lists to store MRI image data and their corresponding labels. |
| `for image_name in no_tumor_images:`                             | I started looping through all the 'no tumor' images.                       |
| `if image_name.endswith('.jpg'):`                                | Ensured only JPEG images are processed.                                    |
| `img_path = os.path.join(image_directory, 'no', image_name)`     | Constructed the full path for each 'no tumor' image.                       |

| `dataset.append(np.array(img))`                                  | Added the processed image (as a NumPy array) to the dataset list.          |
| `labels.append(0)`                                               | Appended label `0` for images with no tumor.                               |
| `if not isinstance(dataset, list): dataset = list(dataset)`      | Ensured `dataset` remains a list before continuing.                        |
| `for image_name in yes_tumor_images:`                            | I then looped through all the 'yes tumor' images.                          |
| `if image_name.endswith('.jpg'):`                                | Processed only `.jpg` format files.                                        |
| `img_path = os.path.join(image_directory, 'yes', image_name)`    | Constructed path for each 'yes tumor' image.                               |
| `img_cv = cv2.imread(img_path)`                                  | Loaded each tumor image using OpenCV.                                      |
| `if img_cv is not None:`                                         | Skipped any unreadable files.                                              |

| `labels.append(1)`                                               | Labeled tumor images with `1`.                                             |


### Step 4: Data Preprocessing

After collecting and labeling the MRI images, I converted the dataset and labels lists into NumPy arrays to optimize memory usage and computational speed. 
Then, I split the data into training and testing sets (80%-20%) using train_test_split. 
Finally, I normalized the pixel values to a 0‚Äì1 range using normalize() from Keras utilities, which helps the neural network converge faster and more accurately.

### Step 5: Build CNN Model

I created a CNN model using Keras‚Äô Sequential API. I began with an Input layer defining the shape of the input images. 
The model architecture included three convolutional blocks with increasing filter sizes, each followed by ReLU activation and max pooling. 
After flattening the output, I added a dense layer with dropout to reduce overfitting, followed by the final output layer with sigmoid activation for binary classification.

| `from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input`                                                                                                        | Imported the `Input` layer to define input shape.                           |
| `model = Sequential()`                                                                                                                             | Initialized the Sequential model.                                           |
| `model.add(Input(shape=(INPUT_SIZE, INPUT_SIZE, 3)))`                                                                                              | Defined the input shape for the CNN.                                        |

### Step 6: Compile the Model

I compiled the CNN model using the binary cross-entropy loss function, suitable for binary classification. 
I selected the Adam optimizer for its adaptive learning capabilities and specified accuracy as the performance metric to monitor during training.

| **Python Code**                                                                     | **# Comments**                                                            |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])` | Compiled the model with appropriate loss, optimizer, and accuracy metric. |

### Step 7: Train the Model

I trained the CNN model using the preprocessed training dataset. 
I selected a batch size of 16 and trained the model for 10 epochs. Additionally, I allocated 10% of the training data for validation to monitor the model‚Äôs performance during training. 
This validation split helped ensure that the model was not overfitting. The training history, including accuracy and loss, was captured for both training and validation sets.

| **Python Code**                                                                         | **# Comments**                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, batch_size=16, epochs=10, validation_split=0.1)` | Trained the model with batch size 16, for 10 epochs, reserving 10% of training data for validation. |

| **Output (Partial)**                                    | **# Comments**                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Epoch 1/10 ‚îÄ accuracy: 0.7192 ‚îÄ val_accuracy: 0.8875`  | Model started learning; validation accuracy already high due to quality preprocessing. |
| `Epoch 5/10 ‚îÄ accuracy: 0.9820 ‚îÄ val_accuracy: 0.9719`  | Model continued to improve, both training and validation accuracies increasing.        |
| `Epoch 10/10 ‚îÄ accuracy: 0.9973 ‚îÄ val_accuracy: 0.9795` | Final epoch achieved excellent performance, nearing 98% accuracy on validation set.    |

### Step 8: Evaluate the Model

After training, I evaluated the model using the test dataset, which was kept completely separate from the training and validation sets. 
This step helps determine the model‚Äôs ability to generalize to new, unseen data. I calculated both loss and accuracy on the test set, and then printed the test accuracy as a percentage to two decimal places. 
The model achieved a high accuracy, indicating strong generalization performance.

| **Python Code**                                   | **# Comments**                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)` | Evaluated the model's performance on the unseen test dataset. |
| `print(f"Test Accuracy: {accuracy*100:.2f}%")`    | Converted the test accuracy to a readable percentage format.  |

| **Output**                                                              | **# Comments**                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `31/31 ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ 0s 10ms/step - accuracy: 0.9714 - loss: 0.1158` | Model achieved \~97.14% test accuracy and low loss, indicating excellent performance. |
| `Test Accuracy: 96.93%`                                                 | Final printed test accuracy rounded and formatted for clarity.                        |

### Step 9: Save the Model

After evaluating the model and confirming its strong performance, I saved the trained CNN model to a file named brain_tumor_cnn_model.keras. 
Saving the model allows for future reuse without the need to retrain, which is useful for deployment, sharing, or continued experimentation. 
I also printed a confirmation message to ensure the save operation completed successfully.

| **Python Code**                             | **# Comments**                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `model.save("brain_tumor_cnn_model.keras")` | Saved the entire trained model (architecture, weights, and optimizer state) to a file. |
| `print("Model successfully saved!")`        | Printed a confirmation message indicating that the model was saved successfully.       |

### Step 10: Load the Model

To verify that the saved CNN model could be reloaded successfully for future use (e.g., inference or continued training), 
I loaded the model from the .keras file using TensorFlow's load_model() function. This confirms the persistence and portability of the trained model. 
I also printed a confirmation message to ensure it was loaded without error.

| **Python Code**                                     | **# Comments**                                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model`    | Imported the function needed to load a previously saved model.                    |
| `import numpy as np`                                | Re-imported NumPy for compatibility, especially if further operations are needed. |
| `model = load_model("brain_tumor_cnn_model.keras")` | Loaded the trained model from the saved `.keras` file.                            |
| `print("‚úÖ Model loaded successfully!")`             | Confirmed that the model was successfully loaded from disk.                       |

| **Output**                     | **# Comments**                                                         |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `‚úÖ Model loaded successfully!` | Confirms that the saved model file was correctly restored into memory. |

### Step 11: Make a Prediction with the Model

To verify that the trained model could make predictions, I created a dummy input with the same shape expected by the CNN (1 image of 64√ó64 pixels with 3 RGB channels). 
I passed this dummy input through the model using predict() and interpreted the result based on a threshold of 0.5. This step helps validate that the model is functioning correctly for inference.

| **Python Code**                                                                                                                | **# Comments**                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `dummy_input = np.random.rand(1, 64, 64, 3)`                                                                                   | Created a random dummy image to simulate a real input.             |
| `prediction = model.predict(dummy_input)`                                                                                      | Generated a prediction score using the trained model.              |
| `print("Prediction output:", prediction)`                                                                                      | Printed the raw probability score returned by the model.           |
| `if prediction[0][0] > 0.5:`<br>¬†¬†¬†¬†`print("Model Prediction: Tumor")`<br>`else:`<br>¬†¬†¬†¬†`print("Model Prediction: No Tumor")` | Interpreted the output: values > 0.5 = "Tumor", else = "No Tumor". |

| **Output**                        | **# Comments**                                           |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Prediction output: [[0.159118]]` | The prediction score indicates low confidence for tumor. |
| `Model Prediction: No Tumor`      | Final interpretation of the model‚Äôs decision.            |

### Step 12: Analyze Training Performance (Check for Overfitting)

To evaluate model generalization and check for overfitting, I visualized the training vs validation accuracy and training vs validation loss using Matplotlib. 
These plots help identify issues like underfitting or overfitting by comparing model behavior on training and unseen validation data over each epoch.

| **Python Code**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | **# Comments**                                                             |

### Step 13: Plot Accuracy and Loss Graphs

After training, I visualized the training and validation accuracy and loss across epochs to monitor learning trends and identify potential overfitting or underfitting.

### Step 14: Evaluate on Test Set (Again)

I re-evaluated the model on the test set after training with augmented data to confirm real-world performance.

| **Python Code**                                   | **# Comments**                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)` | Evaluated model performance on the test dataset. |
| `print(f"Test Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")`  | Printed test accuracy in a readable format.      |

| **Output**              | **# Comments**                            |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `Test Accuracy: 96.93%` | Model performed very well on unseen data. |

### Step 15: Data Augmentation

To improve generalization, I applied real-time data augmentation using ImageDataGenerator, introducing random transformations during training.

| **Python Code**                                                       | **# Comments**                                                               |

### Step 16: Check Class Balance

I computed class weights to ensure balanced learning, especially if the dataset is imbalanced between tumor/no tumor classes.

| **Python Code**                                                                                      | **# Comments**                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `from sklearn.utils import class_weight`<br>`class_weights = class_weight.compute_class_weight(...)` | Computed balanced class weights.      |
| `print("Class weights:", class_weights)`                                                             | Printed the weights for both classes. |

### Step 17: Confusion Matrix & Metrics

I used confusion_matrix and classification_report to evaluate precision, recall, and F1-score ‚Äî providing a complete view of model performance.

| **Python Code**                                                       | **# Comments**                                 |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix` | Imported evaluation metrics.                   |
| `y_pred = model.predict(x_test)`                                      | Predicted on the test set.                     |
| `y_pred = (y_pred > 0.5).astype("int32")`                             | Converted probabilities to binary predictions. |
| `print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))`                             | Printed the confusion matrix.                  |
| `print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))`                        | Displayed precision, recall, f1-score, etc.    |

| **Output (Summary)**                                            | **# Comments**                                            |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Accuracy: 97%`<br>`Precision/Recall/F1: High for both classes` | Confirmed the model performs excellently on both classes. |

### Step 18: Retrain with Augmentation

I retrained the model using the augmented training data via .flow() to improve generalization and reduce overfitting.

| **Python Code**                               | **# Comments**                             |

### Step 19: Build a Prediction Pipeline

I developed a reusable function to preprocess and predict MRI images for tumor detection. This function loads an image, resizes, normalizes, and predicts using the trained CNN.

| **Python Code**                                                                   | **# Comments**                           |

| `predict_image(image_path)`                                                       | Ran a sample prediction on a new image.  |

| **Output**                                     | **# Comments**                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
